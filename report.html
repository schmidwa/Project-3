    <ul>
        <li>
            Deploy Site:
            <div>
             Our site is deployed <a href="https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/schmidwa/343s23/Project-3/">here</a>  and our github is <a href="https://github.com/schmidwa/Project-3">here</a>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            is responsive
            <div>
                We resize the reponse image from deepai to better fit on mobile through media queries.
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            uses 2 different apis
            <div>
                We use the spotify API to grab out the users playlists, then we have the user select a playlist, and then we format it and send it to the deepai api to create an stable diffusion image based on playlist name
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            has search
            <div>
                We allow the user to select chosen buttons by searching through their spotify playlists
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            displays results
            <div>
                We display the image from deepai
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            results are filterable
            <div>
                Due to costs associated with deepai, we are unable to make images for all playlists, instead we allow the user to filter it by selecting the one they want.
